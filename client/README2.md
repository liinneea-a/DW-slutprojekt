## How to run the project

First of all you need to install all the dependencies. You do this by typing `npm i` in the terminal.

After the install has completed you type `npm start` in the terminal to start the application.

A live server will start automatically on port 3000 where you will be able to view the site.

## Admin-page

On the admin page you have tools to add/remove/edit collections and NFTs (items for sale)

## Design system

In this project we used components from [Material UI](https://mui.com/#/) that implements Google's [Material Design system](https://material.io/).
